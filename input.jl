# multithreading
# Turn multithreading "on" (highly recommended) or "off" for Ger jobs. 
# On means each Ger job is assigned only 1 cpu core and multiple jobs will 
# be running at the same time. Off means all cpu cores work on one job at 
# a time. Tests show that multithreading is much faster. Vc and Gcav jobs 
# are set to be always multithreaded.

# "yes" or "no". Notice the lower case and the double quotation.
# No means to start a new job from begining.

# read all existing Ger.log files and figure out which jobs are finished and 
# which are not, and then restart the Ger jobs for the unfinished jobs.
