# why is the Cavity type SES in Vc calculation using vdw cavity
	this is for Ger calcultion, and ses is better for it.

# are volumes the same in Vc.log and Ger.log?
	yes

# why is the data in VGer.dat (used for EOS fitting) structure-independent

# user-specific spheres -- format differnt in Gcav.com from others
	noaddedsph for vdw cavity; the default is ses cavity

# can I run Gcav calculations before Ger calculations?

# cavitation energy, fixed Vc, mean pressure?

# pressure calculation formula, dG/dV

# are gaussian checkpoint files necessary
